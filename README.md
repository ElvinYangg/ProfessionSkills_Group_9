## Target Audience
- Students and professionals interested in structured innovation and problem-solving techniques.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the application of the Six Thinking Hats method in structured innovation. We explore this through a case study of a local pizzeria facing a downturn in sales and customer retention, offering various strategies to enhance performance.

## Highlights of the Poster
- **Scenario Setting**: We use the example of a once-popular local pizzeria that has noticed a decline in sales and customer retention. This scenario helps illustrate the practical application of the Six Thinking Hats method.
- **Introduction to the Six Thinking Hats**: We introduce Dr. Edward DeBonoâ€™s mental training model, explaining how each "hat" represents a different focus in thinking. This approach emphasizes looking at a problem from six different perspectives to find the best solution.
