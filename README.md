## Introduction to the Six Thinking Hats
- **Introduction to the Six Thinking Hats**: We introduce Dr. Edward DeBono’s mental training model, explaining how each "hat" represents a different focus in thinking. This approach emphasizes looking at a problem from six different perspectives to find the best solution.

## Target Audience
- Non-scientific audience management（Entrepreneur）

## Project Overview
